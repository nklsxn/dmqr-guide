These notebooks demonstrate how to use [MQR](https://nklsxn.github.io/mqr/latest/)
for quality improvement in engineering design and manufacturing.

Documentation

Clone this repository to your local machine, then open the notebooks using [jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

These notebooks form part of the documentation for the library [MQR](https://nklsxn.github.io/mqr/latest/).
For instructions on how to install MQR and further details about its features, see the MQR docs.

The notebooks in the `master` branch contain outputs, so that they can be viewed
